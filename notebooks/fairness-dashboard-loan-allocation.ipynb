    "# Using Fairness Dashboard with Loan Allocation Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to use [`Fairlearn`](https://fairlearn.github.io/) and the Responsible AI Widget's Fairness dashboard to generate predictors for the Census dataset. This dataset is a classification problem - given a range of data about 32,000 individuals, predict whether their annual income is above or below fifty thousand dollars per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this notebook, we shall treat this as a loan decision problem. We will pretend that the label indicates whether or not each individual repaid a loan in the past. We will use the data to train a predictor to predict whether previously unseen individuals will repay a loan or not. The assumption is that the model predictions are used to decide whether an individual should be offered a loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first train a fairness-unaware predictor and use the fairness dashboard to demonstrate how this model leads to unfair decisions (under a specific notion of fairness called *demographic parity*). We then mitigate unfairness by applying the `GridSearch` algorithm from `Fairlearn` package."

    "We could load these predictors into the Fairness dashboard now. However, the plot would be somewhat confusing due to their number. In this case, we are going to remove the predictors which are dominated in the accuracy-disparity space by others from the sweep (note that the disparity will only be calculated for the protected attribute; other potentially protected attributes will not be mitigated). In general, one might not want to do this, since there may be other considerations beyond the strict optimization of accuracy and disparity (of the given protected attribute)."
